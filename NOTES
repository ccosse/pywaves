NOTES: pywaves

adding air-H20 interface ... gravity and pressure=p(h)
need a cell class so can have attrs ... 
and probably the bag-of-filled-cells, bag-of-atm-cells
or maintain more grids with 1s 2s and 0s to signify if filled, interface or atm cell. 
will need to get pressure given depth below interface 
(question: as waves goes over point on bottom does pressure increase?)
need to understand linsolve(p,div) ... 
also want obj oriented, since python ...

first pass at interface in get_from_ui ... adding f=const for j<N/2 and f+=f(h) deeper. 
still computing equations for all cells, but this already creates a velocity interface/transition layer ... 
exhibits reflection? ....

	float Fg;
	for(j=1;j<N+1;j++){
		Fg=-0.001;
		if(j>N/2)Fg += (-0.01*(j-N/2))/N;	
		for(i=1;i<N+1;i++){
			
			v[IX(i,j)]=Fg;
		}
	}	

implementing pressure map ...
